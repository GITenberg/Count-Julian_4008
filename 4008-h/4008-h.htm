<p style="text-align: center">LONDON:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">PRINTED FOR JOHN MURRAY, FLEET

<div class="gapmediumdoubleline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> daughter of Count Julian is
usually called Florinda&mdash;a fictitious appellation,
unsuitable to the person and to the period.&nbsp; Never was one
devised more incompatible with the appearance of truth, or more
fatal to the illusions of sympathy.&nbsp; The city of Covilla, it
is reported, was named after her.&nbsp; Here is no improbability:
there would be a gross one in deriving the word, as is also
pretended, from La Cava.&nbsp; Cities, in adopting a name, bear
it usually as a testimony of victories or as an augury of
virtues.&nbsp; Small and obscure places, occasionally, receive
what their neighbours throw against them; as Puerto de la mala
muger in Murcia.&nbsp; A generous and enthusiastic people, beyond
all others in existence or on record, would affix no stigma to
innocence and misfortune.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that the most important era in Spanish
history should be the most obscure.&nbsp; This is propitious to
the poet, and above all to the tragedian.&nbsp; Few characters of
such an era can be glaringly misrepresented, few facts
offensively perverted.</p>

<p class="poetry"><i>Opas</i>.&nbsp; See her, Count Julian: if
thou lovest God,<br />
See thy lost child.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Jul.</i>&nbsp; I have avenged me, Opas,<br
/>
More than enough: I sought but to have hurled<br />
The brands of war on one detested head,<br />
And died upon his ruin.&nbsp; O my country!<br />
O lost to honour, to thyself, to me,<br />
Why on barbarian hands devolves thy cause,<br />
Spoilers, blasphemers!</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Opas</i>.&nbsp; Is it thus, Don Julian,<br
/>
<a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>When thy own
ofspring, that beloved child,<br />
For whom alone these very acts were done<br />
By them and thee, when thy Covilla stands<br />
An outcast, and a suppliant at thy gate,<br />
Why that still stubborn agony of soul,<br />
Those struggles with the bars thyself imposed?<br />
Is she not thine? not dear to thee as ever?</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Jul.</i>&nbsp; Father of mercies! show me
none, whene&rsquo;er<br />
The wrongs she suffers cease to wring my heart,<br />
Or I seek solace ever, but in death.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Opas</i>.&nbsp; What wilt thou do then, too
unhappy man?</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Jul.</i>&nbsp; What have I done
already?&nbsp; All my peace<br />
Has vanished; my fair fame in after-times<br />
Will wear an alien and uncomely form,<br />
Seen o&rsquo;er the cities I have laid in dust,<br />
Countrymen slaughtered, friends abjured!</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Opas</i>.&nbsp; And faith?</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Jul.</i>&nbsp; Alone now left me, filling up
in part<br />
The narrow and waste intervals of grief:<br />
It promises that I shall see again<br />
My own lost child.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p class="poetry"><i>Jul.</i>&nbsp; Till I have met the tyrant
face to face,<br />
And gain&rsquo;d a conquest greater than the last;<br />
Till he no longer rules one rood of Spain,<br />
And not one Spaniard, not one enemy,<br />
The least relenting, flags upon his flight;<br />
Till we are equal in the eyes of men,<br />
The humblest and most wretched of our kind,<br />
No peace for me, no comfort, no&mdash;no child!</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Opas</i>.&nbsp; No pity for the thousands
fatherless,<br />
The thousands childless like thyself, nay more,<br />
The thousands friendless, helpless, comfortless&mdash;<br />
Such thou wilt make them, little thinking so,<br />
Who now, perhaps, round their first winter fire,<br />
Banish, to talk of thee, the tales of old,<br />
Shedding true honest tears for thee unknown:<br />
Precious be these, and sacred in thy sight,<br />
Mingle them not with blood from hearts thus kind.<br />
If only warlike spirits were evoked<br />
By the war-demon, I would not complain.<br />
Or dissolute and discontented men;<br />
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>But wherefor
hurry down into the square<br />
The neighbourly, saluting, warm-clad race,<br />
Who would not injure us, and could not serve;<br />
Who, from their short and measured slumber risen,<br />
In the faint sunshine of their balconies,<br />
With a half-legend of a martyrdom<br />
And some weak wine and withered grapes before them,<br />
Note by their foot the wheel of melody<br />
That catches and rolls on the sabbath dance.<br />
To drag the steddy prop from failing age,<br />
Break the young stem that fondness twines around,<br />
Widen the solitude of lonely sighs,<br />
And scatter to the broad bleak wastes of day<br />
The ruins and the phantoms that replied,<br />
Ne&rsquo;er be it thine.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Jul.</i>&nbsp; Arise, and save me,
Spain!</p>

Receiving orders from and answering<br />
These desperate and heaven-abandoned slaves,<br />
They might perceive some few external pangs,<br />
Some glimpses of the hell wherein I move,<br />
Who never have been fathers.</p>

To whom brave Spaniards must refer their wrongs!</p>

No virtues have redeemed them from their bonds;<br />

And the close cringes of ill-whispering want,<br />
Educate them to plunder and obey:<br />
Active to serve him best whom most they fear,<br />

And racks alone remind them of the name.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Opas</i>.&nbsp; O everlasting curse for
Spain and thee!</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Jul.</i>&nbsp; Spain should have vindicated
then her wrongs<br />
In mine, a Spaniard&rsquo;s and a soldier&rsquo;s wrongs.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Opas</i>.&nbsp; Julian, are thine the only
wrongs on earth?<br />
And shall each Spaniard rather vindicate<br />
Thine than his own? is there no Judge of all?<br />
Shall mortal hand seize with impunity<br />
The sword of vengeance, from the armory<br />
Of the Most High? easy to wield, and starred<br />
With glory it appears; but all the host<br />
Of the archangels, should they strive at once,<br />
Would never close again its widening blade</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Jul.</i>&nbsp; He who provokes it hath so
much to rue.<br />
Where&rsquo;er he turn, whether to earth or heaven,<br />
He finds an enemy, or raises one.</p>

success<br />
Hath followed him who warred upon his king.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Jul.</i>&nbsp; Because the virtue that
inflicts the stroke<br />
Dies with him, and the rank ignoble heads<br />
Of plundering faction soon unite again,<br />
And, prince-protected, share the spoil, at rest.</p>

The joy of innocence, the calm of age,<br />
The probity of manhood, pride of arms,<br />
And confidence of honour! the august<br />
And holy laws, trampled beneath thy feet.<br />
And Spain!&nbsp; O parent, I have lost thee too!<br />
Yes, thou wilt curse me in thy latter days,<br />
Me, thine avenger.&nbsp; I have fought her foe,<br />
Roderigo, I have gloried in her sons,<br />
Sublime in hardihood and piety:<br />
Her strength was mine: I, sailing by her cliffs,<br />
By promontory after promontory,<br />
Opening like flags along some castle-towers,<br />
Have sworn before the cross upon our mast<br />
Ne&rsquo;er shall invader wave his standard there.</p>

Yet, amidst all this grief and infamy,<br />
&rsquo;Tis something to have rushed upon the ranks<br />
In their advance; &rsquo;twere something to have stood<br />
Defeat, discomfiture; and, when around<br />
No beacon blazes, no far axle groans<br />
Thro&rsquo; the wide plain, no sound of sustenance<br />
Or succour sooths the still-believing ear,<br />
To fight upon the last dismantled tower,<br />
And yield to valour, if we yield at all.<br />
But rather should my neck lie trampled down<br />
By every Saracen and Moor on earth,<br />
Than my own country see her laws o&rsquo;erturn&rsquo;d<br />
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>By those
who should protect them: Sir, no prince<br />
Shall ruin Spain; and, least of all, her own.<br />

Or, if there be such, any viler passion<br />
To have its giddy range, and to be gorged,<br />
It rises over all your sacraments,<br />
A hooded mystery, holier than they all.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Rod.</i>&nbsp; Hear me, Don Julian; I have
heard thy wrath<br />
Who am thy king, nor heard man&rsquo;s wrath before.</p>

Xeres is ours; from every region round<br />
True loyal Spaniards throng into our camp:<br />
Nay, thy own friends and thy own family,<br />
From the remotest provinces, advance<br />
To crush rebellion: Sisabert is come,<br />
Disclaiming thee and thine; the Asturian hills<br />
Opposed to him their icy chains in vain;<br />
But never wilt thou see him, never more,<br />
Unless in adverse war, and deadly hate.</p>

Or leave them to our sword, and all beyond<br />
The distant Ebro to the towns of France<br />
Shall bless thy name, and bend before thy throne.<br />
I will myself accompany thee, I,<br />
The king, will hail thee brother.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Jul.</i>&nbsp; Ne&rsquo;er shalt thou<br />
Henceforth be king: the nation, in thy name,<br />
May issue edicts, champions may command<br />
The vassal multitudes of marshall&rsquo;d war,<br />
And the fierce charger shrink before the shouts,<br />
Lower&rsquo;d as if earth had open&rsquo;d at his feet,<br />
While thy mail&rsquo;d semblance rises tow&rsquo;rd the ranks,<br

But God alone sees thee.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Rod.</i>&nbsp; What hopest thou?<br />
To conquer Spain, and rule a ravaged land?<br />
To compass me around, to murder me?</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Jul.</i>&nbsp; No, Don Roderigo: swear thou,
in the fight<br />
<a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>That thou

That, if I ever save thee from a foe&mdash;</p>

Do thou present my crown and dignity.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Jul.</i>&nbsp; Darest thou offer any price
for shame?</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Rod.</i>&nbsp; Love and repentance.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Jul.</i>&nbsp; Egilona lives:<br />
And were she buried with her ancestors,<br />
Covilla should not be the gaze of men,<br />

deserve the throne.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Jul.</i>&nbsp; And Egilona&mdash;what hath
she deserved,<br />

<p class="poetry"><i>Rod.</i>&nbsp; But the realm in vain<br />
Hoped a succession.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Jul.</i>&nbsp; Thou hast torn away<br />
The roots of royalty.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Rod.</i>&nbsp; For her, for thee.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Jul.</i>&nbsp; Blind insolence! base
insincerity!<br />
Power and renown no mortal ever shared<br />
Who could retain, or grasp them, to himself:<br />
<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>And, for
Covilla? patience! peace! for her?<br />
She call upon her God, and outrage him<br />
At his own altar! she repeat the vows<br />
She violates in repeating! who abhors<br />
Thee and thy crimes, and wants no crown of thine.<br />
Force may compell the abhorrent soul, or want<br />
Lash and pursue it to the public ways;<br />
Virtue looks back and weeps, and may return<br />
To these, but never near the abandon&rsquo;d one<br />
Who drags religion to adultery&rsquo;s feet,<br />
And rears the altar higher for her sake.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Rod.</i>&nbsp; Have then the Saracens
possest thee quite,<br />
And wilt thou never yield me thy consent?</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Jul.</i>&nbsp; Never.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Rod.</i>&nbsp; So deep in guilt, in
treachery!<br />
Forced to acknowledge it! forced to avow<br />
The traitor!</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Jul.</i>&nbsp; Not to thee, who reignest
not,<br />
But to a country ever dear to me,<br />
And dearer now than ever: what we love<br />
Is loveliest in departure!&nbsp; One I thought,<br />
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>As every
father thinks, the best of all,<br />
Graceful, and mild, and sensible, and chaste:<br />
Now all these qualities of form and soul<br />
Fade from before me, nor on any one<br />
Can I repose, or be consoled by any.<br />
And yet in this torne heart I love her more<br />
Than I could love her when I dwelt on each,<br />
Or clasped them all united, and thanked God,<br />
Without a wish beyond.&mdash;Away, thou fiend!<br />
O ignominy, last and worst of all!<br />
I weep before thee&mdash;like a child&mdash;like mine&mdash;<br

And tell my woes, fount of them all! to thee!</p>

By its gay hand-maid, from the high alcove,<br />

When violence, or perfidy, invades,<br />
Or when unworthy lords hold wassail there,<br />

At last they fix their steddy and stiff eye<br />
There, there alone&mdash;stand while the trumpet blows,<br />

That she herself, clasping me once again<br />
To her sad breast, had said, Covilla! go,<br />

sounds along these halls;<br />
Hardly his foot hath past them, and he flees<br />
From his own treachery&mdash;all his pride, his hopes,<br />

Now falsehood sinks from under him: behold,<br />

Behold the chapel of thy earliest prayers,<br />
Where I, whose chains are sunder&rsquo;d at thy sight<br />
Ere they could close around these aged limbs,<br />
Received and blest thee, when thy mother&rsquo;s arm<br />
Was doubtful if it loosed thee! with delight<br />
Have I observed the promises we made<br />
Deeply imprest and manfully perform&rsquo;d.<br />
Now, to thyself beneficent, O prince,<br />
Never henceforth renew those weak complaints<br />
Against Covilla&rsquo;s vows and Julian&rsquo;s faith,<br />
His honour broken, and her heart estranged.<br />
O, if thou holdest peace or glory dear,<br />
Away with jealousy&mdash;brave Sisabert,<br />
Smite from thy bosom, smite that scorpion down;<br />
It swells and hardens amid mildewed hopes,<br />
O&rsquo;erspreads and blackens whate&rsquo;er most delights,<br

And renders us, haters of loveliness,<br />
The lowest of the fiends: ambition led<br />
The higher on, furious to disposess,<br />
From admiration sprung and phrenzied love.<br />
<a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>This
disingenuous soul-debasing passion,<br />
Rising from abject and most sordid fear,<br />
Stings her own breast with bitter self-reproof,<br />
Consumes the vitals, pines, and never dies.<br />

Glorious and high the stature, she assumes;<br />
But watch the wandering changeful mischief well,<br />
And thou shalt see her with low lurid light<br />
Search where the soul&rsquo;s most valued treasure lies,<br />
Or, more embodied to our vision, stand<br />
With evil eye, and sorcery hers alone,<br />
Looking away her helpless progeny,<br />
And drawing poison from its very smiles.<br />
For Julian&rsquo;s truth have I not pledged my own?<br />
Have I not sworne Covilla weds no other?</p>

Virtue and valour and experience<br />
Are never trusted by themselves alone<br />
Further than infancy and idiocy;<br />
The men around him, not the man himself,<br />
Are looked at, and by these is he prefer&rsquo;d:<br />
&rsquo;Tis the green mantle of the warrener<br />
And his loud whistle, that alone attract<br />

Reflect her image&mdash;but acknowledged them<br />

Unfelt and unregarded: now behold<br />

<p class="poetry"><i>Her.</i>&nbsp; Often we hardly think
ourselves the happy<br />
Unless we hear it said by those around.<br />
O my lord Julian, how your praises cheer&rsquo;d<br />
Our poor endeavours! sure, all hearts are open<br />
Lofty and low, wise and unwise, to praise.<br />
<a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>Even the

Our blessings and our prayers; the corse itself<br />
Hath shined with other light than the still stars<br />
Shedd on its rest, or the dim taper, nigh.<br />
My father, old men say, who saw him dead<br />
And heard your lips pronounce him good and happy,<br />
Smiled faintly thro&rsquo; the quiet gloom, that eve,<br />
And the shroud throbbed upon his grateful breast.<br />
Howe&rsquo;er it be, many who tell the tale<br />
Are good and happy from that voice of praise.<br />
His guidance and example were denied<br />
My youth and childhood: what I am I owe&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Jul.</i>&nbsp; Hernando, look not back: a
narrow path<br />
And arduous lies before thee, if thou stop<br />

Closely and rigidly another&rsquo;s way,<br />
But, free and active, follow up thy own.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Her.</i>&nbsp; The voice that urges now my

O happy days of (far departed!) peace,<br />
Days when the mighty Julian stooped his brow<br />
Entering our cottage door; another air<br />
Breathed thro&rsquo; the house; tired age and lightsome youth<br
/>
Beheld him, with intensest gaze&mdash;these felt<br />
More chastened joy; those, more profound repose.<br />
Yes, my best lord, when labour sent them home<br />
And midday suns, when from the social meal<br />
The wicker window held the summer heat,<br />
Prais&rsquo;d have those been who, going unperceived,<br />
Open&rsquo;d it wide, that all might see you well:<br />
Nor were the children blamed, upon the mat,<br />
Hurrying to watch what rush would last arise<br />
From your foot&rsquo;s pressure, ere the door was closed,<br />
And not yet wondering how they dared to love.<br />
Your counsels are more precious now than ever,<br />
But are they&mdash;pardon if I err&mdash;the same?<br />
Tarik is gallant, kind, the friend of Julian,<br />
<a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>Can he be
more? or ought he to be less?<br />
Alas! his faith!</p>

<p class="poetry"><i>Jul.</i>&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis God&rsquo;s, not
thine&mdash;embrace it not, nor hate it.<br />
Precious or vile, how dare we seize that offering,<br />
Scatter it, spurn it, in its way to heaven,<br />
Because we know it not? the sovran lord<br />
Accepts his tribute, myrrh and frankincense<br />
From some, from others penitence and prayer:<br />
Why intercept them from his gracious hand?<br />
Why dash them down? why smite the supplicant?</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Her.</i>&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis what they do?</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Jul.</i>&nbsp; Avoid it thou the more.<br />
If time were left me, I could hear well-pleased<br />
How Tarik fought up Calpe&rsquo;s fabled cliff,<br />
While I pursued the friends of don Roderigo<br />
Across the plain, and drew fresh force from mine.<br />
O! had some other land, some other cause,<br />
<a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>Invited
him and me, I then could dwell<br />
On this hard battle with unmixt delight.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Her.</i>&nbsp; Eternal is its glory, if the
deed<br />
Be not forgotten till it be surpast:<br />
Much praise by land, by sea much more, he won,<br />
For then a Julian was not at his side,<br />
Nor led the van, nor awed the best before;<br />
The whole, a mighty whole, was his alone.<br />
There might be seen how far he shone above<br />
All others of the day: old Muza watched<br />
From his own shore the richly laden fleet,<br />
Ill-arm&rsquo;d and scatter&rsquo;d, and pursued the rear<br />
Beyond those rocks that bear St. Vincent&rsquo;s name,<br />
Cutting the treasure, not the strength, away&mdash;<br />
Valiant, where any prey lies undevour&rsquo;d<br />
In hostile creek or too confiding isle:<br />
Tarik, with his small barks, but with such love<br />
As never chief from rugged sailor won,<br />
Smote their high masts and swelling rampires down;<br />
And Cadiz wept in fear o&rsquo;er Trafalgar.<br />
Who that beheld our sails from off the hights,<br />
<a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>Like the
white birds, nor larger, tempt the gale<br />
In sunshine and in shade, now almost touch<br />
The solitary shore, glance, turn, retire,<br />
Would think these lovely playmates could portend<br />
Such mischief to the world; such blood, such woe;<br />
Could draw to them from far the peaceful hinds,<br />
Cull the gay flower of cities, and divide<br />
Friends, children, every bond of human life;<br />
Could dissipate whole families, could sink<br />
Whole states in ruin, at one hour, one blow.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Jul.</i>&nbsp; Go, good Hernando&mdash;who
<i>would</i> think these things?<br />
Say to the valiant Tarik, I depart<br />
Forthwith: he knows not from what heaviness<br />
Of soul I linger here; I could endure<br />
No converse, no compassion, no approach,<br />
Other than thine, whom the same cares improved<br />
Beneath my father&rsquo;s roof, my foster-brother,<br />
To brighter days and happier end, I hope;<br />
In whose fidelity my own resides<br />
With Tarik and with his compeers and chief.<br />

Without his answer: yes, my friends! yes, Tarik,<br />
Now will I speak, nor thou, for once, reply.<br />
There is, I hear, a poor half-ruin&rsquo;d cell<br />
In Xeres, whither few indeed resort;<br />
Green are the walls within, green is the floor<br />
And slippery from disuse; for christian feet<br />
Avoid it, as half-holy, half-accurst.<br />
Still in its dark recess fanatic sin<br />
Abases to the ground his tangled hair,<br />
And servile scourges and reluctant groans<br />
Roll o&rsquo;er the vault uninterruptedly,<br />
Till, such the natural stilness of the place,<br />
The very tear upon the damps below<br />
<a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>Drops
audible, and the heart&rsquo;s throb replies.<br />
There is the idol maid of christian creed,<br />
And taller images, whose history<br />
I know not, nor inquired&mdash;a scene of blood,<br />
Of resignation amid mortal pangs,<br />
And other things, exceeding all belief.<br />
Hither the aged Opas of Seville<br />
Walked slowly, and behind him was a man<br />
Barefooted, bruized, dejected, comfortless,<br />
In sack-cloth; the white ashes on his head<br />
Dropt as he smote his breast&mdash;he gathered up,<br />
Replaced them all, groan&rsquo;d deeply, looked to heaven,<br />
And held them, like a treasure, with claspt hands.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Egil.</i>&nbsp; O! was Roderigo so
abased?</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Muza</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas he.<br />
Now, Egilona, judge between your friends<br />

The king, thy lord, Roderigo, to disgrace.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Egil.</i>&nbsp; He merited&mdash;but not

<p class="poetry"><i>Abd.</i>&nbsp; Few words, and indistinct:
repentant sobs<br />
Filled the whole space; the taper in his hand,<br />
Lighting two small dim lamps before the altar,<br />
He gave to Opas&mdash;at the idol&rsquo;s feet<br />
He laid his crown, and wiped his tears away:<br />
The crown reverts not, but the tears return.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Egil.</i>&nbsp; Yes, Abdalazis! soon,
abundantly.<br />
If he had only called upon my name,<br />
Seeking my pardon ere he looked to heaven&rsquo;s,<br />
I could have&mdash;no! he thought not once on me!<br />
Never shall he find peace or confidence;<br />
I will rely on fortune and on thee<br />
Nor fear my future lot: sure, Abdalazis,<br />
A fall so great can never happen twice,<br />
Nor man again be faithless, like Roderigo.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

faithless.<br />
Fainter must be the charms, remote the days,<br />
When memory and dread example die,<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
